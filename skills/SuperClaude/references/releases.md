## v4.1.5: v4.1.5
**Published:** 2025-09-26

## What's Changed

* Version bump by @mithun50 in https://github.com/SuperClaude-Org/SuperClaude_Framework/pull/394
* The -i flag has been removed from the `_run_command_cross_platform` function in `setup/components/mcp.py`.

* fix: Prevent installer from hanging during MCP installation

The SuperClaude installer was hanging during the installation of MCP components on non-Windows systems. This was caused by the use of an interactive shell (`-i`) when executing the `claude mcp add` command. The interactive shell would attempt to read from standard input, causing the process to be suspended by the shell.

This commit fixes the issue by removing the `-i` flag from the `_run_command_cross_platform` function in `setup/components/mcp.py`. This ensures that the installation process runs non-interactively and completes without hanging.

* fix: Add 'cmd /c' for Windows and refactor shell execution

This commit resolves an issue with `npx` command execution on Windows by prepending `cmd /c` to the command. It also refactors the shell command execution for non-Windows systems to use the `executable` argument in `subprocess.run` for a cleaner and more robust implementation.
